            <h2>BootStrap</h2>
            <p>I use this tool for projects that are less design intensive.</p>
            <p>
              It helps me come up with good designs and functionalities in a
              short space of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also make use of the themes that this framework has got to
              offer.

            <h2>Firebase</h2>
            <p>
              Recently discovered this tool and I must say, it has proven to be
              one powerful tool to set up the backend for a project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although I have also used other tools such as the AWS Elastic
              beanstalk to achieve the same goals, I seem to like firebase
              better because of its sophisticated yet easy technic for solving
              complicated backend functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              User authentication and payments using technologies such as stripe
              have made project build procedures to be such a breeze.

            <h2>Git & GitHub</h2>
            <p>
              Coming from a self-taught who has broken many applications I was
              working on due to a lack of proper files and project management,
              discovering Git & GitHub was such a relief.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nowadays, having a git repo and running commits are more like
              second nature while working on projects.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div
            className={
              toggleState === 4 ? "content  active-content" : "content"
            }
          >
            <i>
              <FaUnity />
            </i>
            <h2>Unity</h2>
            <p>
              Although being a game engine, I find this tool really helpful in
              building some interactive designs. The fact that it also supports
              javascript makes it easy for me to dive in and make some
              nice-looking apps with it.Â
